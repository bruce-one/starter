There are three Venturer weeks available each year.

The [South Australian](#winter-interstater) week is organised separately to normal weeks and is only open to South Australians. [Find out more.](#winter-interstater)

The remaining two Venturer weeks are available to any Venturer (or close friend [we've even had exchange students!]).

We help organise all your ski gear and coordinate transport (often with help from friendly parents ;-) ) from Melbourne. <i class='material-icons' onclick='alert(this.title);' title='We depart from Heathmont, or if you&#39;re not from Melbourne (or even Victoria), we can still usually help!'>help_outline</i>

Venturer weeks are an amazing experience for an incredibly low price, and can even be used for badgework.
