Because of the remote location (11km out of Falls Creek <i class='material-icons' title='Hover with a link to how to get there.' onclick='alert(this.title)' >help_outline</i>) winter is run as a series week-long events.

Most weeks are open to anyone over 18 (Scout member or not), although some weeks are only available to specific groups.

[Venturers](#winter-venturer) <i class='material-icons' title='15-18 year old Scouts'>help_outline</i> have three weeks; one of which is specifically for <a href='#winter-interstater'>South Australians</a>.

External group bookings are also taken, subject to availability. <i class='material-icons' title='Weeks 11 and 12 are usually available.'>help_outline</i>
